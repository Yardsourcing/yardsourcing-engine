# Yardsourcing Engine

This is the backend engine fueling Yardsourcing, a web application that connects hosts with users looking to rent a yard. The application is built with service oriented architecture and this app does most of the heavy lifting (see [Project Architecture](#project-architecture)). The backend communicates with the frontend using 14 API JSON endpoints. It stores all but the user information in the database.

The API endpoints allow other apps to store Yards (with full CRUD functionality), search yards by address and status, create, approve, reject, or cancel bookings associated to a yard, as well as view all host or renter upcoming bookings. There is automatic email functionality that ties into our Sinatra Sendgrid API Microservice that confirms bookings and approvals from hosts. To utilize this functionality, please set up the Sendgrid Microservice (see related repos).

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Endpoints can be added. If you plan to use this engine with the frontend web application, if the endpoints are changed subsequent updates will be necessary on the Frontend repository code.

#### Prerequisites

* __Ruby__

  - The project is built with rubyonrails using __ruby version 2.5.3p105__, you must install ruby on your local machine first. Please visit the [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) home page to get set up. _Please ensure you install the version of ruby noted above._

* __Rails__
  ```sh
  gem install rails --version 5.2.5
  ```

* __Postgres database__
  - Visit the [postgresapp](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html) homepage and follow their instructions to download the latest version of Postgres app.

#### Frontend dependancies

* __Google Oauth API__
  - Visit the [google developer tools](https://console.developers.google.com/project) to create an account and follow the instructions to create a project for your server to obtain a client_id and client_secret.

* __Omniauth for Rails__
  Visit the [google api omniauth](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/09/gmail-api-oauth-rails.html) homepage and follow their instructions to get familiar with how to use Omniauth in a rails application.

#### Installing

1. Clone the repo
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/Yardsourcing/yardsourcing-frontend
  ```

2. Bundle Install
  ```
  $ bundle install
  ```

3. Create, migrate and seed rails database
  ```
  $ rails db:{create,migrate,seed}
  ```

4. Set up Environment Variables:
  - run `bundle exec figaro install`
  - add the below variable to the `config/application.yml` if you wish to use the existing email microservice. Otherwise you replace it the value with service if desired.
  ```
    EMAIL_MICROSERVICE: 'https://peaceful-bastion-57477.herokuapp.com'
  ```

  If you do not wish to use the sample data provided to seed your database, replace the commands in `db/seeds.rb`.
